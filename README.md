## Getting Started with server and webpack ##

Clone down the repo then install the node modules in your terminal:

npm install


and install webpack gloabally:

npm install -g webpack


Then you need to set up the node server. The server.js file can be found in the server directory:

node server.js


It is suggested that you install nodemon and run the server through this package:

nodemon server.js

After the server is set up, on a new tab in the terminal run webpack (include the -w tag to have webpack monitor any saves to the program)


webpack -w


Now the app should be running on localhost. The default port is 3000.
